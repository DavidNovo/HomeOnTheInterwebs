From Naivety to The New Century


This has been a long time comming.  Novogrodsky.net started last century as a wiki based site using PHP; the framework was called PHPWiki.  I wonder if it is still around?


It lasted for a while, until the Russian bots found it and edited the pages to advertise 'male enhansments'.  I forgot to turn off the ability for the public to make pages.  What can I say, I was naive back then....


I tried switching to PHPNuke and Drupal, but they were too big for what I wnated to do.  A blog, a place to put my pictures and stuff, not much else.  Those tools are great, don't get me wrong, but they are very, very powerful and can do a lot more than I needed.  I wanted something that I could start small and then grow into.


So, I asked some friends about some options and they said. "Try Hugo".  So I did.


And here I am.
