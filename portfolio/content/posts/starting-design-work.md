My first 100 Day Challenge

I was at the [Digital Design Days](https://www.ddd.it/) recently and I was inspired by [GMunk's](https://gmunk.com/) talk.  He talked about a 100 day chanllenge.  The idea is do something for 100 days consistently.  It does not have to be a big thing, just something.  GMunk decided to take a photo each day for 100 days. 


I have decided to design a page each day for 100 days. I will be learning a lot about CSS and Javascript.  I will also get used to Markdown and Hugo.  Maybe even a little Go.  The rules for the challenge are:
* The content of the page will not change.
* The design will be limited to designs that can be implemented with CSS and Javascript.
* A design may use CSS and/or Javascript.  It does not have to use both.
* The content of the page will be created using Markdown.


The challenge will be to follow the rules above without adding stuff to the mix.
